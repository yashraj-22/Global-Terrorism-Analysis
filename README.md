# Global-Terrorism-Analysis

## Problem Statement
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland. Explore and analyze the data to discover key findings pertaining to terrorist activities.

## Project Summary
The project aims to analyze global terrorism data to identify patterns and trends in terrorist activities. The analysis will be based on the Global Terrorism Database, which contains information on terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970 to 2017. The project will start with data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent then we used statistical methods to find out insights from data and with the help of different visual charts we get pictorial representation of insights which helped us to understand what were the factors that lead to terrorism and the landscape of terrorism is different in different theatres across world, multiple state sponsored actor and non state actors were there with different end goal and to achieve those end goal, different types of narrative building has been constructed and implemented among the masses of different countries by indoctrination or by forceful means and last but not the least the ultimate goal of the project is to provide insights that can be used by governments, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders to develop effective counter-terrorism strategies.

## Observations
* The number of terrorist attacks has increased since the 1970s, with a significant increase after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. However, there has been a slight decrease in recent years.
* Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has consistently experienced the most terrorism, followed by South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
* Bombings/explosions are the most common type of attack used by terrorists, followed by armed assaults and assassinations.
* Civilians are the most common target of terrorist attacks, followed by military and police targets.
